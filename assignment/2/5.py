# <Distinct Sequences>
# Given two strings S and T, return the number of distinct subsequences of S which
# equals T. A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string
# by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining
# characters' relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while
# "AEC" is not).
