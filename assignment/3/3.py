# [Cross the River]
# Some people want to cross a river by boat. Each person has a weight, and each boat can
# carry an equal maximum weight limit. Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time,
# provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most boatâ€™s weight limit. Return the
# minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
# Note that it is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.
