# [Monkeys and Bananas]
# There are N Monkeys and N bananas are placed in a straight line.
# Each monkey want to have a banana, if two monkeys want to own the same banana, there
# will be a fight! A monkey can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or
# move one step left from x to x 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 second. Assign monkeys to
# banana so that no monkey fight each other and the time when the last monkey gets a banana
# is minimized.
