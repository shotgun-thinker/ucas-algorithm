# [Permutation Partition]
# Bob is given a permutation p1, p2, . . . , pn of integers from 1 to n and an integer k, such that
# 1 ≤ k ≤ n. A permutation means that every number from 1 to n is contained exactly once.
# Consider all partitions of this permutation into k disjoint segments. Formally, a partition is
# a set of segments {[s0, s1], [s1 + 1, s2], . . . , [sk 1 + 1, sk]}, such that: 1 = s0 < s1 < s2 < . . . <
# sk 1 < sk = n. Two partitions are different if there exists a segment that lies in one partition
# but not the other.
# Bob wants to calculate the partition value, defined as Pki=1 maxsi 1≤j≤sipj for all possible
# partitions of the permutation into k disjoint segments. Please help him find the maximum
# possible partition value over all such partitions, and the number of ways to make partition with
# this value.
