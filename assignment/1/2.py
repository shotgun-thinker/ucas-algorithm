# Consider an n-node complete binary tree T, when n=2^d-1 for some d.
# Each node v of T is labeled with a real number x_v. You may assume
# that the real numbers labeling the nodes are all distinct. A node v
# of T is a local minimum if the label x_v is less than the label x_w
# for all nodes w that are joined to v by an edge.
# You are given such a complete binary tree T, but the labeling is
# only specified in the following implicit way: for each node v, you
# can determine the value x_v by probing the node v.
