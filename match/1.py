# [Description]
# Bob has encountered a difficult problem, and hope you design an algorithm to calculate pow(a,b) mod 1337,
# where a is a positive integer, b is a very large positive integer and will be given in the form of an array.
# For example, pow(2,3) mod 1337 is 8.
# [Constraints]
# 1 <= a <= 2^31-1, 1 <= b.length <= 2000, 0 <= b[i] <= 9
# b doesn't contain leading zeros.
# Please give an algorithm with O(logn) complexity.
# [Input]
# Line 1a integers
# Line 2a array
# [Output]
# one integer

# ---------- [ code ] ----------
def solve(a: int, b: list) -> int:
    pass
